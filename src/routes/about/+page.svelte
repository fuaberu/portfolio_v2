			Hello! My name is Kevin, Developer who started programming as a hobby and turned it into a
			career, with almost 2 years of hands-on working experience and a post graduation in software
			development. Committed to continuous learning, I consistently seek innovative ways to deliver
			enhanced value to customers.
		</p>
		<p>
			My interest in web development dates back to 2021 when I began playing with HTML and CSS, it
			started a journey that led me to work as a full-time software engineer, in the company I'm
			currently at. Today, my main focus is to continuasly improve my skills and build the best
			experience for the users of my applications.

		<p>
			I am excited about creating things that live on the internet and am always eager to take on
			new challenges. Let's connect and create something amazing together!
